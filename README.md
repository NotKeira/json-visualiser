# JSON Visualiser (WebApp)

The JSON Visualiser Web App is designed to help you visualise your `.json` data in a more structured manner, without overloading your eyes when the `.json` is succeptably big.

If you want to run this locally you'll need the following:

- Node.JS

- Docker (optional)


1. Installing and preparing the project
- - Clone the repository to your CWD: `git clone https://github.com/NotKeira/json-visualiser`
